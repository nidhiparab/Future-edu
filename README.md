# Future-edu

     Quality education shouldn’t be an opportunity but a necessity. During the course of our admission process, we realized how challenging it could be to pick a college that not only understands all our needs but is also aligned with our aptitude. There most certainly exists a perfect fit for every student but there isn’t one correct pathway that might lead them to that choice. We want to make educational resources accessible to each individual for overall, nation-wide development.
     This has motivated us to create a one-stop educational counselling website where their credentials tell them what university would be most suitable. The user could then choose from amongst the list and put in their applications accordingly.



## Objectives

- To provide information about various engineering colleges throughout Mumbai.
- To impart a user-friendly platform that does their work for them.
- To publicize colleges that are not so high up in the pecking order.
- To help make the admission process easier
- To eliminate admission bottlenecks and simplify the operation with custom inputs.
